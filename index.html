            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              I'm Rajesh Sharma, a DevOps and Cloud Infrastructure Engineer with 16+ years of experience building secure, scalable, and reliable systems. I specialize in Linux/Windows administration, CI/CD pipelines, automation, and container orchestration with Kubernetes. I also specialize in License Server Management. I love solving tough problems, streamlining workflows, and sharing knowledge with my team. Always curious, I'm passionate about learning new technologies and applying agile principles to deliver solutions that matter.
            
            </p>
            <p>
                Recently, I've been diving deep into Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning  building several projects to apply what I learn, from automation enhancements to intelligent monitoring solutions. I'm still exploring and experimenting every day, and I look forward to contributing to impactful AI-driven initiatives if given the opportunity.
            </p>
